# This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

# Examples:
# accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
# accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
# accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
# The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

def accum(s):
    list = []
    for i,e in enumerate(s):
        ans = e*(i+1)
        low = ans.lower()
        cap = low.capitalize()
        list.append(cap)
    return "-".join(list)
